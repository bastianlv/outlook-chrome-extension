# Outlook Chrome extension

This is an extension for Google Chrome which improves the Outlook webmail and calendar in a few ways:

* Shows unread message count in window title of webmail: `(3) Mail - me@domain.com`
* When a meeting notification appears in the calendar window DOM, pops up a focus-stealing alert
* When a meeting location is just a URL, makes the location a link
